Connects to AWeber or MailChimp in 2 easy steps so you can start displaying email signup form widgets throughout your website.

== Description ==

The easiest plugin you’ve ever used to add email signup forms to your website. Connect to MailChimp and AWeber (other services coming soon) in 2 easy steps and place unlimited email signup forms throughout your site.

No coding necessary.

Kolakube Email Forms does its best to inherit your theme’s CSS styles and offers no design options. This strictly outputs email form codes and relies on a theme to style it.

This plugin is also used to power the [Email Page Lead](http://kolakube.com/marketers-delight/#page-leads) and is fully compatible with the [Marketers Delight](http://kolakube.com/marketers-delight/) theme.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `kolakube-email-forms` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Tools > Email Service Setup to follow onscreen instructions to connect to your email service (or choose your own custom form code)
4. Once connected, you can now use the 'Kolakube Email Signup Form' widget in the Appearance > Widgets admin screen.
5. [For articles and video guides, check out documentation](http://kolakube.com/email-forms/build/use/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if I don't have AWeber or MailChimp? =

As more email services are included in this plugin (like GetResponse and Constant Contact), you can place your custom HTML form code into the widget.

= Can I customize email forms with this plugin? =

No, this plugin specializes in just outputting your forms and offers no styling or design functionality. The form code has been built to integrate into any WordPress theme and inherit their styles the best it can.

== Screenshots ==

1. In order to use the email widget, you must first connect to an email service.

2. Once you select a service (as of 1.0, only MailChimp and AWeber are supported), click 'Get Authorization Code' to get a unique API/auth code to paste into the text box and click 'Connect'.

3. If the connection is successful, you will see the success screen. You can now use the email widget.

4. All of your email lists are available for your choosing in a select box, as well as some other personalization fields.

5. Depending on which email service you connect to, you will get different settings to play with. The screenshot below is what the widget looks like when you're connected to AWeber (as opposed to the MailChimp widget above).

6. Here is what the widget looks like if you choose to use a custom form code.
